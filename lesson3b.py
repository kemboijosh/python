# IF statements
# They are used to make decisions in our code and they allow us to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is true

number = 10
# check if the number is greater than zero
if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive")
    #it ony executes this block of code if the condition is true otherwise it skips it
