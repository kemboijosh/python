# using a function that accepts parameters, calculate the simple interest. The formula for simple interest,
# is: Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100 simple interest=45000rate is 7% and time is  
# 5 years
# use the function inside a loop to calculate the simple interest for 3 different sets of values for principal, rate and time.

    interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100
